# Weather

## Notices:
Implement an iOS native app using Swift 4.1 to demonstrate weather information. The current version is working with Xcode Version Xcode 9.1

## Requirement:
* Use a UITableViewController to display weather information of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane as start.
* Provide a way to add more cities using another modal view controller which includes a search functionality to find a city by name or location.
* City IDs
 - Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are: 4163971, 2147714, 2174003
 - Morecitycanbefoundfromfollowinglink:http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/
* Each cell should display at least two pieces of info: Name of city on the left,
temperature on the right.
* Get real time weather information using https://openweathermap.org/current - You
can register and get your API key for free.
* A sample request to get weather info for one city:
 - http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=4163971&units=metri c&APPID=your_registered_API_key
* Weather should be automatically updated periodically.
* Use Storyboard and Autolayouts.
* It is fine to use 3rd party libraries via CocoaPods or by other means.

## Brownie Points:
* Use an activity indicator to provide some feedback to user while waiting for network response.
* Allow user to tap on a cell to open a new “Detail view”, to show more information about the city such as current weather summary, min and max temperature, humidity, etc.
* Try to use table view or collection view to display details.
* In the “Detail view”, implement animations to enhance the user experience.
* Support all different dimensions of the devices.
* Support landscape and portrait view together
